LIBER SECUNDUS,

Utcunque afflittam poenis projecerit ultro

Hanc animam, hos sensus, per quos in saecula longe
Tendimus? Aut ita cuiquam aurai simplicis ignis ἱ
Sordet, ut immoto lethi torpere veterno

Malit iners, noetisque perire absorptus in alvo?

Sin foret optandum, nobis-ne indulserit Hostis?
incertum poffit-ne3 at certum est nolle. F urorem
Scilicet effundet totum Pnrdentia magni

Numinis? Aut amens delirat forte, vel iras

Non capit impatiens? An precipitante, quod optent,
Extinguat dextri, quos destinat ipse perenni
supplicio? -·-- Et quianam tandem cess‘amus inertes,
Exclamant, queis bella placent? Nos ferrea dudum
Lex manet, aeterno damnat servatque dolori: 1
Atque adeo, quaecunque olim tentabimus ausa,

Qrid majus, quaeve asperior fortuna superfit?

Haec ergo, haec nobis aspenima' poena, fovere

Has sedes, his consiliis armisquepotiri?

Those thoughts, that wander through Eternity ι’ Them in His anger, whom His anger faves

To perilh rather, swallow'd up and loll To punilh endlesst Wherefore cesse we then,
In the wide womb of uncreated night, ,Say they who coonsel Wsr? We are decreed,
Devoid offense and motion? And who knows, Reserv'd, and destin'd to eterntl woe:

Ῑι doubtful; that He never will, is sure. Thus fitting, thus conluhing, thus in Arma?

Will He, so wile, let loose at once His ire, What! when we fled amrin, pursu'd, and strook
