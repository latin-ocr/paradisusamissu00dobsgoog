288 LIBER SEXTUS.

Hoc forsan suasere-oblata: gaudia pacis.
¹ Nos si iterum audierint, ipss ultro soedera quaerent.
. Tum contra Belus, srmili sermone facetus:
Qram nos protulimus, Dux maxime, ponderis in se
Tantum habuit Ratio, ut multos contunderet, omnes
suspensosque animis paulum attonitosque teneret:
“ Qud bene ni steterint, vaga vix vestigia srstent. ·
Haec illi inter sc lepido sermone serebant
Pedoribus laeti tumidis, certique triumphum
Spe praelibant'es: adeo omnipotentia tela
Temnebant, vano audentes sua fulmina fastu ·
Fulminibus coeli aequare3 emersasque catervas
Ι Ridebant, dubias ut starent formidine capti. .
At longum haud steterunt: animos nova suscitat ira, ‘
Tartareisque adversa furoribus arma ministrat. i
y Protinus (ens tantam virtutem ὃς robora tanta
Caelicolis Daus omnipotens Heroibus addit)

of hard Contenta, and sull os soree urg‘d home: And all His Host derides while they stood

Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, · A while in trouble: but they stood not long: ’
And stumbled many: who receives them right, Rage prompted them at length, and sound them Arma

Had need sromhesd tosoot well understand: , Against such hellish mischies fit t'oppose.
Not understood, this gift they have besides, F orthwith (behold the excellence, the pow'r

They lhew us when our foes walls not upright. Which Gon hau in his migbty Angcls plac'd)
