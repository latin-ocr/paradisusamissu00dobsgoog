A: neque se jattans, nec cursu concitus, Ausa
Effera molitur: quae mox ventura sub auras
corde laboranti servent, feriuntque retorta
Artificem, dira ut rapido Tormenta resultant

Conscia Mens, exspes, monituque remordet acerbo:

Besins his dire attempt: which nigh the birth Of what he was, what is, and what must be,

Now rolling, boiis in his tumultuosis meast, Worsel os worse deeds worse suffering: must ensue.

One step, no more than frons himself, can fly O thou, that with surpaffing Glory crown'd
