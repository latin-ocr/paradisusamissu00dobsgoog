254' LIBER SEXTUS.

Jamque Aurora recens, qualis coelestia templa

Incolit, exierat, radiorum aurique coruscd
AEtherei chlamyde effulgens3 concellit eunti·
Nox trepidans, telisque evanuit ieta diei;
· . Cum totum ardenti rutilantem milite campum,
Ignivomos currusque δι equor, ac flammea circum
Anna reperculfo radiantia lumine lumen,
Diredtasque immane acies, instrudtaque bella
Abdial aspiciens, coelo jam cognita fenfit,
Qtae primus memordffe ratus. Tum laetus amicis
Infert se Superlrm agminibus, plausuque sonoro
Excipitur, Sociorum unus de clade reversus
Integer indomitusque, ex tot modb millibus unus.
Nec mora, laudatum sanai ad fastigia montis
Una omnis duxere Cohors, arcem ante supremam
Sistentes: curn fic nubis penetralibus aureae
Per superas emiffa domos Vox blanda sonabat:
Made alet Virtute, Dar speritate Minister!

Seem twilight here. And now went forth the Moru, To have reported: gladly then he mix'd

Such as in highest Heav’n, array’d in Gold Among those friendly Pow’rr, who him receiru

Shot thro' with orient Beama: when all the Plain That‚ of so many Myriadn fall‘n, yet One
Cover'd with thick embattled Squadrons bright, Return'd‚ not lost. On to tlte sacred hill
crana, ana naming Arma, and ray steca, They rer nm ngr appnuded, ana parent
Refletung blaze on blane, first methis view. Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,

War he perceiv'd‚ war in procindlr and found From midst a Golden Cloud, rhus mild was heard·
Already known, what he for news had thought ι seruam of Gon, well done ςΙ wellhast thou fought
