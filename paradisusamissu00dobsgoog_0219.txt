Cum fulget radiis orbemque Aurora retexit. Ι
Qrin age, jam silvas inter nova pensa sequamur,

Delicias, dulcesque audent recludere odores.
’ Hoc pulchram Adamas Sponsam solamine blando
Demulcet: Sed lapsa oculis stillabat utrisque
Mollis lacrimula, addustis detersa capillis.
Deinde-alias nitidis ὲ sontibus ire paratas
Ut vidit Conjux, lucentibus oscula guttis
Libavit, sanai veneratus signa pudoris
